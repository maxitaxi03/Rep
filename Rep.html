    <h2>
      This is another heading, which means it's another change, but the branch
      master does not have it
    </h2>
    <p>
      This means i have to use the command git pull, to pull this new info
      locally.
    </p>

    <p>Commands I've learnt so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>git clone - adds a new repository on branch master.</li>
      <li>
        git add - adds a new file that can later be committed(the term commited
        means save the newest version of a file)
      </li>
      <li>git status - updates the user on the status of a particular file</li>
      <li>
        git commit - this creates a new version of our file on the branch master
        (git commit -m: the option m adds a message so you know what changes
        you've made)
      </li>
      <li>
        git commit -am adds and leaves a message, essentially combining the
        command git add to git commit -m
      </li>
      <li>
        git push - pushes/adds the changes to the content you made to the
        server, the serve in this case is github
      </li>
      <li>
        git pull - pulls new versions of code from the server to your local
        device
      </li>
      <li>git log - keeps track of all the commits we've made to the code</li>
      <li>
        git reset - if you made a change you didnt mean, and want to go back to
        previous commit. reverts from current to previous
      </li>
      <li>git reset --hard "commit hash": will hard reset everything.</li>
      <li>
        git reset --hard origin/master: origin/master is the version of your
        repository that is on github
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Branching</h3>
    <p>
      Branching is the process of working on different parts of the repository
      at the same time
    </p>
    <p>There is a master branch which is the default branch</p>
    <p>
      The master branch is default branch which holds up to date, stable version
      of code
    </p>
    <p>feature branch is newer additional features</p>
    <p>
      focus on one branch at a time, and where your focus is, current state of
      repository is where head is
    </p>
    <p>
      whereever head is pointing at, means you're working or looking at that
      particular branch
    </p>
    <p>
      after the feature and bug fixes are corrected, it will be merged back on
      the master version of the code.
