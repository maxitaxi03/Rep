    <h2>
      This is another heading, which means it's another change, but the branch
      master does not have it
    </h2>
    <p>
      This means i have to use the command git pull, to pull this new info
      locally.
    </p>

    <p>Commands I've learnt so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>git clone - adds a new repository on branch master.</li>
      <li>
        git add - adds a new file that can later be committed(the term commited
        means save the newest version of a file)
      </li>
      <li>git status - updates the user on the status of a particular file</li>
      <li>
        git commit - this creates a new version of our file on the branch master
        (git commit -m: the option m adds a message so you know what changes
        you've made)
      </li>
      <li>
        git commit -am adds and leaves a message, essentially combining the
        command git add to git commit -m
      </li>
      <li>
        git push - pushes/adds the changes to the content you made to the
        server, the serve in this case is github
      </li>
      <li>
        git pull - pulls new versions of code from the server to your local
        device
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
